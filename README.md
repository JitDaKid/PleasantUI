# PleasantUI

Pleasant UI is the user interface library for Avalonia. Previously, it was only available as part of the Regul and Regul Save Cleaner projects. This project has existed since at least 2021.

This library continues the OlibUI tradition of releasing only later versions, not the very first.

This library is mostly focused on performance, lightness, and beauty, compared to many others.

This library is fully compatible with AOT compilation, and does not need to be added to rd.xml

## Installing

```xml
<PackageReference Include="PleasantUI" Version="3.1.1" />
```
