# Pleasant UI

Pleasant UI is the user interface library for Avalonia. Previously, it was only available as part of the Regul and Regul Save Cleaner projects.

This library continues the OlibUI tradition of releasing only later versions, not the very first.

## Basic concept

- Compared to previous versions of this library, version 3 has removed the ability to create themes, as this process is too complicated for ordinary users to understand;
- The library will have two accent colors - the main color and the opposit.
